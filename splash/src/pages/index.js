    <SEO title="Signalboost: Secure Textblasts and Hotlines for Activists" />
    <p>
      Signalboost lets activists use Signal to send text blasts and receive
      hotline tips on their phones without revealing their identity or spending
      money. <br />
      It is <em style={{ color: '#ff79c6' }}>secure, simple, and free.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Secure:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Signalboost sends messages over <a href="https://signal.org">Signal</a>,
        the most secure encrypted messaging service available for phones.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not display phone numbers or names. People can send and receive
        messages without sharing their identity -- and feel safer if anyone's
        phone is stolen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Signalboost retains the minimal user metadata necessary to route
        messages. Its maintainers, Team Friendo, will resist any attempt to
        compel us disclose it, and are working on{' '}
        <a href="https://0xacab.org/team-friendo/signalboost/issues/68">
          updates
        </a>{' '}
        make such disclosure impossible.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Simple:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Signalboost is for 1-way messaging only. Admins can send announcements
        to large groups and receive hotline tips from anyone. That's it.
      </li>
      <li>
        It does not allow subscribers to send messages to each other. This cuts
        out cross talk endemic to large Signal or WhatsApp groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        It tries to solve one problem and solve it well. This makes it easier to
        know what it's for amidst a dizzying sea of tech tools!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Free:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We are making this software for people's collective liberation, not for
        profit. We do not charge money for it and never will.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    <h3>To get a Signalboost channel:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Send a Signal message to{' '}
        <span style={{ color: '#bd93f9' }}>+1-938-444-8536</span>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Include a name for the channel and the phone numbers of all admins.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will receive a welcome message as soon as your channel is created.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Once you have a channel:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        There will be a signal phone number associated with your channel.
        Anytime you send a message to it, anyone who is subscribed will get that
        message.
      </li>
      <li>
        People can subscribe to announcements by sending a Signal message to
        this phone number that says "HELLO", "HOLA" or "ALLÔ" and leave by
        sending "GOOBYE", "ADIÓS" or "ADIEU."
      </li>
      <li>
        Signalboost speaks English, French and Spanish and everyone can choose
        which language they want to use for commands and notifications. Send a
        Signal message to the channel that says "HELP" to see the command
        options.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can convert the channel into a hotline by sending a message that
        says "HOTLINE ON" to your channel number.
      </li>

    <h3>
      <span name="why" class="anchor" />
      Why should I use Signalboost?
    </h3>
    <p>
      You should use Signalboost if you want to avoid the high cost of SMS
      blasting and you or your community are already using the secure text
      messaging app Signal. With Signalboost you can use Signal to send messages
      to large groups of other Signal users without them having to expose their
      phone numbers (often a very personal and identifying bit of information)
      to all other group members.  Effectively Signalboost offers free text
      blasting that is secured over Signal.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="security" class="anchor" />
      How does Signalboost protect my phone number and identity?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Signalboost protects your identity by hiding your phone number from others
      members of a channel. Even Admins never see the phone numbers of their
      channel Subscribers. Only the Signalboost server and its maintainers know
      the numbers subscribed to each channels so it is essential that they make
      a commitment to protecting that information.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="secure" class="anchor" />
      How does Signalboost keep my messages secure? 
    </h3>
    <p>
      Just like your phone or anyone you communicate with on Signal, Signalboost
      uses encryption on messages so they can only be read by the intended
      recipients. However, because the Signalboost server is effectively a
      recipient it needs to decrypt messages to be read and then relayed to your
      channel. If a Signalboost server is compromised messages it decrypts could
      be read just like on a compromised phone. However, unlike your phone,
      Signalboost does not keep any record of the messages it sends or receives,
      they are deleted immediately after being relayed, no matter what.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="signal" class="anchor" />
      Do I need to be using Signal to use a Signalboost channel?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes. All participants in a Signalboost channel must be using
      Signal. Signal provides both the encryption and delivery mechanism for
      your Signalboost messages.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="cost" class="anchor" />
      How much does using Signalboost cost?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Signalboost is free software and the Signalboost server run by teamfriendo
      is free for communities and organizations we choose to support. Anyone can
      run a Signalboost server and other maintainer may chose to charge for the
      service. Unlike a lot of text messaging apps there is no cost associated
      with sending messages with Signalboost because it leverages Signal to send
      messages instead of costly SMS networks.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="vouche" class="anchor" />
      Can we control who can sign up for our channel?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Yes, Signalboost offers a "vouching" mode. In this mode an invite produced
      either by a Admin or another Subscriber, is required to subscribe to a
      channel.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="opensource" class="anchor" />
      Who owns Signalboost? Is Signalboost open-source?  Who paid you to make
      Signalboost?
    </h3>
     
    <p>
      Signalboost is open-source and free to use. Anyone with the skills and
      desire can set up and run a Signalboost server using our software.
      Signalboost was mostly made without direct funding, as a labor of love.{' '}

    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="listshare" class="anchor" />
      Can I get a list of the subscribers in my Signalboost channel?
    </h3>
    <p>
      No. This is an essential feature of Signalboost. Subscribers phone numbers
      are hidden from each other and even from channel Admins. Only Signalboost
      server maintainers could see this data, so you  have to trust
      them. In the case of teamfriendo our privacy policy forbids us sharing
      this information, ever.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <span name="listshare" class="anchor" />
      Can I pay you to add a feature to Signalboost?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Maybe. We are open to being encouraged to add a feature for money if the
      feature is a useful functionality advancement for the communities we hope
      to serve. You can also fork the code and add any features you like (as
      long as your result remains open source) or become a contributor. <br />

      Can I have a Signalboost channel on the teamfriendo server?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Signalboost is in limited beta and under active development. We are not
      publicly offering channels on our instance at this time. If you would like
      to be considered for our limited beta program you can definitely try{' '}
      <a href="mailto:team-friendo@riseup.net">emailing us</a> to let us know
      about your needs,  but you may not get a response because we are busy
      building so we can leave beta soon!
