HOW IT WORKS
----------------------------

Signalboost channels have admins and subscribers.

-> When admins send messages, they are broadcast to all subscribers.
-> If enabled, subscribers can send responses that only admins can read.
-> Subscribers cannot send messages to each other. (No noisy crosstalk!)

Signalboost channels understand commands.

-> Sending HELP lists the commands.
-> People can subscribe by sending HELLO (or HOLA) and unsubscribe with GOODBYE (or ADIÓS).
-> Sending a language name (for example: ESPAÑOL or ENGLISH) switches languages.

Signalboost tries to preserve your privacy.

-> Signalboost users cannot see each other's phone numbers.
-> Signalboost does not read or store anyone's messages.

${adminPhoneNumber} has been removed from this channel because their safety number changed.

This is almost certainly because they reinstalled Signal on a new phone.

However, there is a small chance that an attacker has compromised their phone and is trying to impersonate them.

Check with ${adminPhoneNumber} to make sure they still control their phone, then reauthorize them with:

ADD ${adminPhoneNumber}

Until then, they will be unable to send messages to or read messages from this channel.`,
