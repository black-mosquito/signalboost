HOW IT WORKS
----------------------------

Signalboost has channels with admins and subscribers:

-> When admins send announcements, they are broadcast to all subscribers.
-> If hotline mode is enabled, anyone can send anonymous messages to the admins.

Signalboost protects your privacy:

-> Users cannot see other users' phone numbers. (Cops can't either!)
-> Signalboost does not read or store the contents of anyone's messages.

Signalboost responds to commands:

-> Send HELP to list them.
