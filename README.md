# Overview <a name="overview"></a>

**signalboost** is a rapid response tool made by and for activists. It enables users to send encrypted text alerts over the [Signal messaging service](https://www.signal.org/) to mass subscriber lists without revealing the sender's phone number to recipients or recipients' phone numbers to each other -- for free. You could use it to send emergency alerts, mobilization updates, urgent requests for aid, or other inventive usages we never could have thought of! :) [[1](#txtmob_joke)]

**The stack** consists of node services calling out to the [signald](https://git.callpipe.com/finn/signald) Java app over unix sockets. See [Application Design](#design) for a detailed overview.

**Issue tracking and bug reports** live in our [gitlab repo on 0xacab.org](https://0xacab.org/Team Friendo/signalboost) You can track **ongoing work** on the [project's kanban board](https://0xacab.org/Team Friendo/signalboost/boards).

**Want to use signalboost for social justice work?**  Send us a signal message at `+1 (938) 444-8536` or email us at `Team Friendo [AT] riseup [DOT] net` ([pgp key here](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xE726A156229F56F1)) to request a signalboost channel for your group. We're also happy to help you learn how to install and maintain your own instance of a signalboost sever so you can run your own channel and not trust Team Friendo with storing your subscriber list(s). :)

**NOTE: this project is not officially affiliated with the Signal App or Foundation.** We are just some humble rad techies trying to help our friends. We are grateful to Moxie, Trevor, and the Signal Foundation for maintaining a generous free/open ecosystem that makes projects like this possible. <@3

[1] *If you are a child of the (anarchist) 90's, you might usefully think of signalboost as "Like TXTMOB, but on Signal." If you cut your teeth on Occupy Wall Street, try "Like Celly, but on Signal." If you were born digital, try "Like Signal, but with text blasts."*

# Application Design <a name="design"></a>

## Data Flow

Data flows through the application in (roughly) the following manner:

* an application server controls several signal numbers, each of which acts as a "channel"
* admins and subscribers can interact with the channel by sending it commands in the form of signal messages. for example: people may subscribe and unsubscribe from a channel by sending a signal message to it that says "JOIN" or "LEAVE" (respectively). admins can add other admins by sending a message that says "ADD +1-555-555-5555", etc.
* when a admin sends a non-command message to a channel, the message is broadcast to all subscriber on that channel
* unlike with signal groups:
  * the message appears to the subscribers as coming from the phone number associated with the channel (not the admin).
  * subscribers may not see each others' phone numbers
  * subscribers may not respond to messages
* unlike with text blast services:
  * messages are free to send! (thanks m0xie!)
  * messages are encrypted between admins and the application and between the application and subscribers (NOTE: they are decrypted and reencrypted momentarily by the application but are not stored permanetly on disk)
  * admins may send attachments to subscribers
* notably: the list of subscribers is currently stored on disk on the signalboost server. if this makes you nervous, you can:
  * host your own instance of signalboost (see docs below)
  * register your desire for us to implement encrypted subscriber tables in the [issue tracker](https://0xacab.org/Team Friendo/signalboost/issues/68)

## Architecture

The application has the following components:

1. a `db` layer with:
  * a `phoneNumbersRepository`: tracks what twilio phone numbers have been purchased, whether they have been registered with signal, and whether they are being used for a channel
  * a `channelsRepository`: keeps track of what channels exist on what phone numbers, and who is publishing or subscribed to any given channel
2. a `registrar` service that:
  * searches for and purchases twilio phone numbers
  * registers twilio phone numbers with signal
  * sends verification codes to signal server (after receiving verification codes sent as sms messages from signal server to twilio, relayed to the app at an incoming `/twilioSms` webhook)
  * creates channels and adds/removes phone numbers, admins, and subscribers to/from them
3. a `dispatcher` service that reads incoming messages on every channel via unix socket connection to `signald`, then processes each message with both:
   * the `executor` subservice parses message for a command (e.g, `ADD` a admin to a channels). if it finds one,
 it executes the command and returns response message.
   * the `messenger` subservice handles the output from the executor. if it sees a command response it sends it to the command issuer. else it broadcasts incoming messages to channel subscribers if access control rules so permit.
   
   
# System and Service Requirements

signalboost relies on a few external service and tools both in production and some specifically for local development. If you are just getting started with signalboost we recommend you walk through this section to get those ready. 

If you are a member of Team Friendo we provide accesss to the exsiting servers and services listed here. Checkout the Secrets for Team Friendo section below. Otherwise the next section will walk you through the setup of services, both for host servers or/and your local development system. 


## Getting started

To host your own instance of signalboost need:

* A server running Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux distributions with a static IP address as your host server.
* A local computer able to run Ansible to deploy the code to your signalboost host server.
* A domain with an A record pointing to the host serverâ€™s static IP address.
* A Twillio account (https://www.twilio.com/) that provides the phone numbers that signalboost will use. 
* An email address to provide to Let's Encrypt (https://letsencrypt.org/) for easy, seamless ssl support.
* A signalboost API Token, a hex key created by you to authenticate on your new signalboost API.

To do local development for signalboost you only need: 

* A local computer able to run node and docker, git and the development tools of your choice. 
* A Twillio account (https://www.twilio.com/) that provides the phone numbers that signalboost will use. 
* A paid Ngrok account https://dashboard.ngrok.com/billing/plan that allows secure tunnelling to your localhost's signalboost API.
* A signalboost API Token, a hex key created by you to authenticate on your new signalboost API.

We'll address the host and development system setup in the Developer and Sysadmin guides later, but for now the next step is to make sure you have the services and authentication details you need to proceed.

## Setup third party services and other details

**API Domain**

If you already have a domain you can use great, if not register one for your new instance and create an A record for the IP address of your host server. For domain name registration we think that [Njal.la](https://njal.la) is hands down the best option. 

**Twillio Account**

To get Twilio credentials, sign up for a Twilio account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio), then visit the [console page](https://www.twilio.com/console) and look for the `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` fields on the righthand side of the page. You will need these for configuration later.  A free account only provides one number but might be enough to get you started. 

**Let's Encrypt Account** 

Let's Encrypt [here](https://letsencrypt.org/) does not require you to create an account, but it will require you to provide an email address in our configuration files so decided what address you want to use here.

**NGROK Tunnel**

You only need Ngrok for local development an `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NGROK_SUBDOMAIN` if you want to run signalboost in a local development environment. (To get an ngrok account, visit [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/signup). See [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/reserved) for setting up reserved custom subdomains.)

**Generate signalboost API Token**

You will need a hex string for the signalboost API Token for both a production deploy and local development. To generate a decently random 32-byte hex string you could do the following on the command line of any *nix system running python3:


```shell 
python
>>> import secrets
>>> secrets.token_hex(32)
```


# Developer Guide <a name="#developer-guide"></a>

We're so happy you want to help write code for signalboost! If you have not already reviewed the System and Service Requirements section above please start there.  

Please also read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, located here:

https://0xacab.org/Team Friendo/signalboost/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md


## Setting up your local development environment 


###(1) Get signalboost

First you'll need to clone the repo:

``` shell
git clone git@0xacab.org:Team Friendo/signalboost
cd signalboost
```

###(2) Install dependancies

To develop signalboost, you should make sure your local computer has the following programs installed:

* make (you probably have this. check with `which make`. if you get output: you have it!)
* docker CE
* docker-compose
* jq

If you would like to be able to run individual unit tests on your computer, you will also want:

* node
* postgresql

Installing those on a debian-flavored computer would involve running the following commands:

``` shell
sudo apt-get install \
     apt-transport-https \
     ca-certificates \
     curl \
     gnupg2 \
     software-properties-common
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
# check fingerprint matches 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88, then:
sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/$(lsb_release -is | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce jq nodejs postgresql
pip install docker-compose
```

On a Mac (tested on 10.14.5 Mojave), that would look like:

``` shell
brew update
brew install docker docker-compose jq node postgresql
brew cask install docker
```

(Note: The `cask` version of docker allows you to run docker from Applications folder, avoid some permissions complexity and get a nice systray icon. Some devs report needing to do that to get dev env working! :))


###(3) Complete configuration 


You will need to provide your own values for credentials listed in `.env.dev`. A sample of the values needed is listed in `.env.dev.example`. You should replace all values in `%TEMPLATE_STRINGS%` with your own values.

Configuration for development basically involves creating your initial .env.dev file and loading it with the details you created in the System and Service Requirements section above.


If you are member of Team Friendo we povide these for you and an easy way to unlock them, jump to the Secrets for Team Friendo Members section. 

#### Secrets for General Public

Copy the `.env.example` file to just `.env` in the root of your signalboost repo.

```
cd path/to/signlaboost/
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need to provide your own values for credentials listed in `.env`. You should replace the values in `%TEMPLATE_STRINGS` with your own values.

For local development only these need to be set. Provide the signalboost API Token you generated for:

``` shell
# signalboost API authentication // Required for authentication in all modes 
# See the README for details on how to generate a suitable HEX string

SIGNALBOOST_API_TOKEN=%HEX STRING%
```

Add your Twillio credentials to:

``` shell
# Twilio // Required in all modes to create channel numbers. Signup at https://www.twilio.com/  
# Free accounts work but are limited to one phone number which will limit your ability to create channels

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=%HEX STRING%
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=%HEX STRING%
```

Add the Ngrok auth token and the subdomain of your reservered domain to:

``` shell
# Ngrok // Used in Development mode only. Provides secure tunnel to your localhost's signalboost API
# A paid "basic" ngrok account is needed https://ngrok.com/ so you can create a "reservered domain" https://dashboard.ngrok.com/reserved
# From the reservered domain we get the subdomain (eg our reserved domain is signalboost.ngrok.io so the subdomain is just signalboost)

NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=%43_BYTE_HEX STRING%
NGROK_SUBDOMAIN=%NAME OF CUSTOM SUBDOMAIN REGISTERED WITH NGROK%
```

#### Secrets for Team Friendo Members <a name="Team Friendo-secrets"></a>

We use [blackbox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) to keep secrets under encrypted version control.

To be able to use it, you first need to whitelist your gpg key:

* [make a working pgp key](http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~lockhart/gpg/) if you don't have one already
* obtain your public key fingerprint (with e.g., `gpg -K`)
* send your pgp public key fingerprint to a signalboost maintainer and ask them to add you to the blackbox whitelist of trusted pgp keys

Now that you are whitelisted, you can use blackbox to decrypt secrets and source them with:

``` shell
make _.unlock
```

which runs `./bin/blackbox/decrypt_all_files` to get you what you need. 

**GOTCHA WARNING:** if you are running an older version of debian or ubuntu (which defaults to gpg v1 instead of gpg v2), you will get inscrutable errors when trying to invoke blackbox. This can be fixed by installing `gpg2` and then invoking blackbox with `GPG=gpg2 ./bin/blackbox/decrypt_all_files`


###(4) Run Setup 

This will build signalboost's docker containers, install its node dependencies, create its database, and run migrations:

``` shell
make _.setup
```

This will take a moment the first time it runs as downloads the docker images and other resources. 


###(5) Stop and start the signalboost App in dev mode 

Now you should be able to start up signalboost. We provide a few really simple make commands for these tasks. 

Run the app in dev mode with:

``` shell
make dev.up
```

To shut the app down gracefully (can take a while for all containers to spin down):

``` shell
make dev.down
```

To force all containers to shutdown immediately:

``` shell
make dev.abort
```

###(6) Install the Boost CLI <a name="cli"></a>

Install* the CLI with:

```shell
make cli.install
```

This puts the commands in `signalboost/cli/boost-commanbds` on your $PATH by symlinking `cli/boost` to `/usr/bin/boost`. If that feels intrusive to you, you are welcome to put `boost` on your $PATH in another way, or by just invoking it as `signalboost/cli/boost`.

You can uninstall it later with:

``` shell
make cli.uninstall
```

Note that to use the `boost` cli tool against your local dev server, you will always have to pass `-e .env.dev` as an argument to all `boost` calls in order to tell boost to talk to your local server instead of prod.

If you find it annoying to type this over and over again, consider adding `export SIGNALBOOST_ENV_FILE=.env.dev` to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent file in your favorite shell program). This will set `.env.dev` as your default `.env` file, which you can still override by passing an explicit value to `-e` when invoking `boost`. (For example: `boost -e .env list-channels` would list all channels on prod.)


###(7) Seed Data

Once you've got the CLI installed, you can use the following to create 2 Twillio numbers. Please note that this is specific to our local development setup as it uses the -u to specify the ngrok tunnel domain you created, for Team Friendo we use signalboost.ngrok.io but your Ngrok reserved domain will be different:

``` shell
make dev.up
boost -e .env.dev create-number -n 2 -u signalboost.ngrok.io -u signalboost.ngrok.io
```

Look for the first phone number returned by this call. Let's call it <channel_phone_number>. Let's call the phone number that you use in daily life <your_actual_phone_number>.

You can use the following to create a channel that uses <channel_phone_number> as its number and uses <your_actual_phone_number> as an admin of the channel, again using the Ngrok reserved domain you created rather than signalboost.ngrok.io:


```shell
boost create-channel \
    -e .env.dev \
    -p <channel_phone_number> \
    -n "my new channel" \
    -a <your_actual_phone_number> \
    -u signalboost.ngrok.io
```

Congrats! you should now have your first channel running on your local development instance of signalboost. 

## Using the App and Tools

With the app running...

Any human should be able to:

* Join the channel by sending a signal message with contents "JOIN" to `$CHANNEL_PHONE_NUMBER`
* Leave the channel by sending a signal message with contents "LEAVE" to `$CHANNEL_PHONE_NUMBER`

Any admin should be able to:

* Broadcast a message to all channel subscribers by sending it to `$CHANNEL_PHONE_NUMBER`
* Receive all messages broadcast to the channel

### Makefile

We have a lot of scripts to help run the app that are all defined in the repo's `Makefile`. You can list them all with:

``` shell
make help
```

If you type `make` and then hit `TAB`, you will get autocomplete suggestions for whatever you have typed so far.

### Run Tests

``` shell
make test.all
```

If you want, you can run unit and e2e tests separately:

``` shell
make test.unit
```

``` shell
make test.e2e
```

### Database scripts

There are a few scripts to do things with the db:

To run all pending migrations (useful if another dev created migrations you haven't run yet):

```shell
make db.migrate.up
```

To drop the database (you will need to recreate seed data after this):

```shell
make db.drop
```

To get a psql shell (inside the postgres docker container for signalboost):

```shell
make db.psql
```

### Using the Boost CLI 


## Installing boost

Assuming you have already provided secrets in `.env` or `.env.dev` (as described in the [Secrets](#secrets) section of the [Developer Guide](#developer-guide)) and have already installed the CLI with:


```shell
make cli.install
```

## Using boost

You can administer any running signalboost instance with:

``` shell
boost <command> <options> -e <path to .env file>
```

Where `<command>` is one of the following:

``` shell
  help
    - shows this dialogue

  add-admin -c <channel phone number> -a <admin phone number> -e <path to .env file>
    - adds an admin to a channel on the signalboost instance specified in .env file

  create-channel -p <chan_phone_number> -n <chan_name> -a <admins> -e <path to .env file>
    - creates a channel with provied phone number, name, and admins on signalboost instance specified in .env file

  create-number -a <area_code> -n <numbers_desired> -e <path to .env file>
    - purchases n new twilio numbers and registers them w/ signal via registrar on instance specified in .env file

  destroy -p <phone_number> -e <path to .env file>
    - permanently deletes the provided phone number on instance specified in .env file

  list-channels -e <path to .env file>
    - lists all channels active on the signalboost instance specified in .env file

  list-numbers -e <path to .env file>
    - lists all numbers purchased from twilio on the signalboost instance specified in .env file

  release-numbers <path>
    - releases all phone numbers with twilio ids listed at given path

  recycle -p <phone_numbers> -e <path to .env file>
    - recycles phone numbers for use creating new channels on signalboost instance specified in .env file
```

For more detailed instructions on any of the commands, run:

``` shell
boost <command> -h
```
## A note on .env files and boost

### Using multiple environments

If you would like to use `boost` to administer multiple different environments, you may provide create credentials in multiple different .env files, and then pass different values to the `-e` flag each time you invoke `boost`.

For example, assume you had two different servers, one in The Arctic Sea, and one in Antarctica. You could create an `.env` file for the Arctic Sea instance in the signalboost project root, and call it `.env.arctic` and similarly create `.env.antarctic` for the instance in Antarctica.

Then, to list all the channels in your Antarctic instance, you would use:

```shell
boost -e .env.antarctic list-channels
```

To list all the channels in your Arctic instance, you would use:

```shell
boost -e .env.arctic list-channels
```

### Setting default environments

You can set a default `.env` file for boost by declaring a value for `$SIGNALBOOST_ENV_FILE` somewhere in your `~/.bashrc` (or in another manner that ensures that `$SIGNALBOOST_ENV_FILE` is always in scope whenever you invoke boost.)

To continue the above example, if you found that you always are trying to use `boost` with your Arctic instance and almost never want to use it with your Antarctic instance, you might find it annoying to always have to accompany every command with `-e .env.arctcic`.  In that case, you could set `.env.arctic` as the default and list the channels on your Arctic server as follows:

```
export SIGNALBOOST_ENV_FILE=.env.arctic
boost list-channels
```

To avoid having to export `SIGNALBOOST_ENV_FILE` in every bash session, you could add the export statement to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file (or the equivalent for your favorite shell program).


# Sysadmin Guide <a name="sysadmin-guide"></a>

Want to deploy an instance of signalboost on the official Team Friendo server or your own? Great! This section is for you!

It contains guides on system requirements you'll need to get started and two separate guides for people who want to run their own instances of signalboost ([Deploy Instructions for General Public](#deploy-public)) and Team Friendo members trying to learn how we deploy the mainline instance ([Deploy Instructions for Maintainers](#deploy-Team Friendo))


## Deploy Instructions for General Public <a name="deploy-public"></a>

If you are a person who is not maintaining this repo, we want you to be able to install and maintain your own version of signalboost too! We just can't share our account credentials or server infrastructure with you -- sorry!

We've designed our deploy process so that you should be able to use it with your own credentials and infrastructure with some minor modifications. (If any of these steps don't work, please don't hesitate to post an issue so we can fix it!)

### (1) Setup third party services 

**Host Server**

Signup for a server and note it's static IP. // ask austin about memory usage?

If you need help finding a server, we'd recommend shopping for a VPS from one the following lovely social-justice oriented groups:

- [Njalla](https://njal.la)
- [Greenhost](https://greenhost.nl)
- [1984](https://1984.is)
- [Mayfirst](https://mayfirst.org)

*We do not recommend DigitalOcean, as a matter of fact it will not work at all as Signal blocks traffic from this service.*

With your new server login and:

- Create a signalboost user
- run `apt update`
- install python 
- Install ssh keys  // ask austin about this magic


**Domain **

If you already have a domain you can use great, if not register one for your new instance and create an A record for the IP adderss of your host server. For domain name registration we think that [Njal.la](https://njal.la) is hands down the best option. 

**Twillio Account**

To get Twilio credentials, sign up for a Twilio account [here](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio), then visit the [console page](https://www.twilio.com/console) and look for the `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` fields on the righthand side of the page.  A free account only provides one number but might be enough to get you started. You will need these in step three.

**Let's Encrypt Account** 

Creat a Let's Encrypt account [here](https://letsencrypt.org/) A free account provides ssl support for // ask austin about what this does?

*NGROK Tunnel*

You only need an `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` and `NGROK_SUBDOMAIN` if you want to run `signalboost` in a local development environment. (To get an ngrok account, visit [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/user/signup). See [here](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/reserved) for setting up reserved custom subdomains.)


###(2) Configure you local deploy system

**Install the signalboost codebase**

`git clone git@0xacab.org:Team Friendo/signalboost.git`

**Install Ansible**

To deploy a signalboost instance, you will need to be running:

* ansible
* ansible-playbook
* various ansible roles from ansible-galaxy

If you are running debian-flavored linux, you can do this with:

``` shell
sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install ansible
cd path/to/signalboost
make ansible.install
```

Our `make` file will install the Ansible dependancies.

If you are on another system, [install ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html). Then run these commands to install the Ansible dependancies manually:

``` shell
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.docker
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.pip
ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.os-hardening
ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.ssh-hardening
```

**Write configs**

You will need to customize two files with the service details you created in step one. From the root of the signalboost code run:

```
cp .env.example .env
cp ansible/inventory.example ansible/inventory
```

Edit the new .env file to replace the the values surrounded by `%` marks with actual values. This file mostly holds the authentication details for third party services and your signalboost host server.


```
shell
# signal boost api service

SIGNALBOOST_HOST_URL=%DOMAIN NAME FOR PROD SERVER%
SIGNALBOOST_API_TOKEN=%HEX STRING%

# letsencrypt/nginx proxy configs

VIRTUAL_HOST=%DOMAIN NAME FOR PROD SERVER%
LETSENCRYPT_HOST=%DOMAIN NAME FOR PROD SERVER%
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=%EMAIL ADDRESS FOR TEAM SYSADMIN%

# twilio

TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=%HEX STRING%
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=%HEX STRING%

```

include ansible/inventory


**(3) Provision and deploy signalboost:**

This step uses ansible to provision a server, install signalboost and all of its dependencies, then deploy and run signalboost.

It uses four playbooks (all of which can be found in the `ansible/playbooks` directory):

1. `provision.yml` (sets up users and system dependencies, performs basic server hardening)
1. `deploy.yml` (builds signalboost docker containers, installs and runs signalboost inside of them)
1. `harden.yml` (performs advanced server hardening -- takes a long time!)

You can run all playbooks with one command:

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/main.yml
```

*Variation to accomodate multiple remote hosts and .env files:*

By default the deploy tooling described aboe assumes you are deploying to one single server, with a `host` listed as `signalboost` in `ansible/inventory` and credentials listed in `.env`. But perhaps you would like to deploy signalboost to multiple servers, each with different credentials!

 To do this, we can leverage ansible's "extra-vars" feature, defining a `sb_host` and `env_file` variable that we pass to `ansible-playbook` at deploy-time to override the defaults we have encoded in `inventory.signalboost` and `.env`.

For example, to deploy to a host listed as `antarctica` in `ansible/hosts` and credentials defined in`.env.antarctica`, you would issue the following command:

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e "sb_host=antarctica env_file=/path/to/.env.antarctica" playbooks/main.yml
```

**(4) Install the `boost` CLI tool:**

signalboost ships with a cli tool for adding phone numbers, channels, and admins to the service.

Install it with:

``` shell
make cli.install
```
Learn more about how the CLI tools works in [Using the CLI](#cli).

**(6) Provision new twilio phone numbers:**

The below will provision 2 phone numbers in area code 510. (If you omit the `-n` and `-a` flag, boost will provision 1 number in area code 929.)

``` shell
boost new_numbers -n 2 -a 510
```

**(7) Provision new signalboost channels:**

Assuming the above returns by printing a success message for the new twilio phone number `+15105555555`, the below would create a new channel called `conquest of bread` on that phone number, administered by people with the phone numbers `+151066666666` and `+15107777777`.

``` shell
boost new_channel -p +15105555555 -n "conquest of bread" -a "+151066666666,+15107777777"
```

For more commands supported by the `boost` cli tool see the [Administering](#administering) section below.

**(8) Deploy updates to signalboost:**

On subsequent (re)deployments, you do not need to run the `provision`, `configure`, or `harden` playbooks. Instead you can just run:

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/deploy.yml
```

## Deploy Instructions for Team Friendo <a name="deploy-Team Friendo"></a>

If you are a member of `Team Friendo`, here are instructions on how to provision, deploy, and maintain a running signalboost instance. :)

*NOTE: If you are administering an already-existent signalboost instance, you can omit steps 3 and 4.*

#### Initial Deployment

**(1) Load secrets:**

``` shell
make _.unlock
```

*NOTE: we use [blackbox](https://github.com/StackExchange/blackbox) for pgp-based credentials management. It is provided in `signalboost/bin/` as a convenience.


**(2) Obtain a server:**

*NOTE: If you are administering an already-existing signalboost instance, omit this step and skip straight to Step 5  ! :)*

``` shell
./bin/get-machine
```

**(3) Provision and deploy signalboost:**

*NOTE: If you are administering an already-existing signalboost instance, omit this step and skip straight to Step 5  ! :)*

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/main.yml
```

*Variation 1:* The above will deploy secrets by copying them from `<PROJECT_ROOT>/.env` on your local machine. If you would like to copy them from elsewhere, provide alternate path to the `deploy_file` ansible variable (specified with an `-e deploy_file=<...>` flag). For example, to copy environment variables from `/path/to/development.env`, run:

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/main.yml -e env_file /path/to/development.env
```

*Variation 2:*: If you would like to deploy secrets by decrypting the copy of `.env.gpg` under version control (and thus more likely to be up-to-date), add the `-e "deploy_method=blackbox"` flag. For example:

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/main.yml -e deploy
```

*Timing Note:* The last playbook (`harden.yml`) can take as long as 2 hours to run. After `deploy.yml` is finished. Thankfully, you can start using signalboost before it is complete! Just wait for the `deploy.yml` playbook (which will display the task header `Deploy signalboost`) to complete, and proceed to the following steps...

**(4) Install the `boost` cli tool:**

We have a cli tool for performing common sysadmin tasks on running signalboost instances. You can install it with:

``` shell
make cli.install
```

To learn more about how the CLI tool works, see [Using the CLI](#cli)

**(5) List existing numbers/channels:**

You can check out what numbers and channels already exist with:

```shell
boost list-numbers
boost list-channels
```

**(6) Provision new twilio phone numbers:**

The below will provision 2 phone numbers in area code 510:

``` shell
boost create-number -n 2 -a 510
```

*NOTE: If you omit the `-n` and `-a` flag, boost will provision 1 number with a non-deterministic area code.*

**(7) Provision new signalboost channels:**

Assuming the above returns by printing a success message for the new twilio phone number `+15105555555`, the below would create a channel called `conquest of bread` on that phone number, and set the phone numbers `+151066666666` and `+15107777777`as senders on the channel.

``` shell
boost create-channel -p +15105555555 -n "conquest of bread" -a "+151066666666,+15107777777"
```

For more commands supported by the `boost` cli tool see the [Administering](#administering) section below.

**(8) Deploy updates to signalboost:**

On subsequent (re)deployments, you do not need to run the `provision`, `configure`, or `harden` playbooks. Instead you can just run:

``` shell
cd ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/deploy.yml
```

If you would like an easier way to do this (and are okay with the `env_file` location being set to `<PROJECT_ROOT>/.env` and the `secrets_mode` set to `copy`), you can simply run:

``` shell
cd <PROJECT_ROOT>
make _.deploy
```
